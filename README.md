# Tsunami-Detection

This is a SIH project. I and my team members made this project with AI Based Solution. In this Project We made a software in which we take SAR Images as Input & alter to clear noise this working done in matlab. Then, we have used SVM algorithm of ML to enhanced the features of images & Detect Tsunami areas. Then, we can provide magnitude, Area & Range of Earthquake on Web app, after that this data is pass through Azure Cloud & used Decision Forest Regression Algorithm for Detecting the Tsunami & alert through SMS, Email, Android App & web app.
